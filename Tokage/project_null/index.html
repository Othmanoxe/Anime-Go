Ace was freed, but he sacrificed his life to protect Luffy from Marine admiral Akainu. Ace's death ultimately proved to be the catalyst leading to Luffy training for two years to become strong enough to protect his friends, paving the way for the second half of the series.</li>

He spend his whole childhood admiring and learning from his brother,that's why the fact that he saw his beloved Ace diying while defending him almost drove him crazy.

                Jiraiya or Pervy Sage as Naruto used to call him, Jiraiya made his debut in the first season of the Naruto anime series
                and soon took the titular character under his
                wing. He played a huge part in molding the anime’s hero into a powerful ninja and was the first of Naruto’s mentors to
                attempt to teach him how to control his Nine-Tails power. Sadly Jiraiya's time was cut short in Naruto Shippuden as soon
                as he came face to face with "Pain" (Jairaiya's former student). During the battle "Pain" managed to severe Jairaiyaa's
                arm and crush his throat and finally kill him.

                    Of all the deaths that occur during Akame Ga Kill, Tatsumi's probably hits the hardest. It's hard to say whether
                    Tatsumi's final moments are so difficult to watch because Night Raid has lost so much already, or if it's because he's
                    the main character and the one person who never needed to be wrapped up in the rebellion against the Empire. Whether he needed to step up or not, Tatsumi sacrifices everything to save the people of his city from the child emperor attacking them. His actions change the course of the world and help Night Raid achieve everything they set out to accomplish, even if it costs Tatsumi his life and his promise to Akame. Akame's despair at Tatsumi's decision only makes his final moments worse, ending the anime on an incredibly bittersweet note.

Two key members, "Erwin Smith" and "Armin Arlelt", are both on the verge of passing away. Only one thing can save them: an injection of Titan serum. But there's only enough for one person, and a choice must be made. Levi has a long history with Erwin, and cares about him deeply. What's more, he's their commander. But ultimately, he hardly chooses Armin, both because Levi believed that Erwin had done enough for the Corps and deserved to rest, and because Armin's strategic mind and genius was something they needed for the future. So, he made the difficult decision to say goodbye to his oldest friend, and save Armin's life.
